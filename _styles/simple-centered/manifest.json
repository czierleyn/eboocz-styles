So if I was a minimalist my copyright statement could simply look like this '© 2015 Christian Zierleyn' and a line with 'All rights reserved.'. On a Mac the copyright symbol can be typed by hitting 'Alt + g'. Of course you can put a lot more on this page, like your address, website address, contact information, isbn and more. Just pick up a couple of books from your shelves or open a couple of books on your ereader to see how other publishers make use of this page.",
