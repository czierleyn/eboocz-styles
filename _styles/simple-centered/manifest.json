So if I was a minimalist my copyright statement could simply look like this '© 2015 Christian Zierleyn' and a line with 'All rights reserved.'. On a Mac the copyright symbol can be typed by hitting 'Alt + g'. Of course you can put a lot more on this page, like your address, website address, contact information, isbn and more.

In this style, the epigraph is centered, with a margin of 3em. The trick is in the p + p. The first paragraph has a top margin of 3em, the second a top margin of 0.4em. 

For those writers who love epigraphs I have made a style that can accomodate up to 6 epigraphs. The third paragraph has a top margin of 2em and the fourth again a top margin of 0.4 em. And so on. This way the quotes and writer names are grouped together and you can just type on without having to think about styling. 

There's one thing you have to think about though. Don't add paragraphs within a quote, because then the margins will be a mess."
