Simple Centered Copyright Page 

This is the copyright page of the book. The only element that is absolutely required on a copyright page is a simple copyright statement consisting of the © symbol, the year of publication, your name and a short statement that the rights to reproduce this book are reserved to the copyright holder. So if I was a minimalist my copyright statement could simply look like this '© 2015 Christian Zierleyn' and a line with 'All rights reserved.'. On a Mac the copyright symbol can be typed by hitting 'Alt + g'. Of course you can put a lot more on this page, like your address, website address, contact information, isbn and more. Just pick up a couple of books from your shelves or open a couple of books on your ereader to see how other publishers make use of this page. Of course, if you're publishing under a Creative Commons license, you can put it right here, instead of the standard copyright text

The style of the copyright page is quite simpel. The text is 90% and presented as one block of text. This means every paragraph has a margin and padding of 0em. This makes it simple to put every part of the copyright statement on a new line. If you do want paragraphs with a margin, you could use a paragraph with a &nbsp;
